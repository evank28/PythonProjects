# Python Projects Repository
##### Author: Evan Kanter
### Purpose

This repository is to store and showcase some of my personal projects that have been written in the Python Language.

### Directory List

1. **AP Create Project** \
    This project was coded in 2017 for the AP CS Principles Course. It contains 
    a tool for automating some operations on 2 Google Spreadsheets, that were used to keep track of event booking and staffing for my high school's Stage Crew. See explanation in repo for ther details.
    
2. **Grad Clothing Voting**\
    This project was coded in 2019 as a way of fairly tabulating votes. 
    As a student council representative organizing Graduating Clothing, 
    students had to vote fairly for their preferred colour for their sweater
     based on the available colours from the vendor. 
     This was a complicated decision with *many* available colours. 
     I used the Single Transferable Vote method, which has voters rank all the 
     options in their order of preference, and then tabulates this as to 
     maximize the combined preferences of the voterbase. I implemented this with
      a Google Form to collect votes and a script in this folder to tabulate 
      them per STV.
    
3. **Learning**\
    This folder contains some short files I wrote code in when playing around with various libraries to learn their functionality.

4. **Stock Algorithms**\
    This project was originally coded in 2019 and has been updated incrementally.
     It is used to make algorithmic stock predictions based on existing 
     investing strategies. See it's README for more.
     
5. **Housholding Addresses**\
    This project was coded in 2018 to take a list of mail recipients, as output by the
NationBuilder CRM system, and to prepare this list for efficient mailing by
postal mailing. The *main goal* of this is to prevent multiple pieces of mail
from being sent to the same address -- this is costly and inefficient. Instead,
names at one address are combined in a way that is consistent with natual
language, and letters are address appropriately to multiple recipients.
This improves significantly on NationBuilder's built in functionality, and is essential for anyone who is running a direct mail campaign based on a list in NationBuilder.
